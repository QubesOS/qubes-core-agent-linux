print_usage() {
cat >&2 <<USAGE
Usage: $0 vmname command arguments
Executes a command in another VM using the qubes.VMShell RPC service.  The
arguments are joined with spaces and passed to "bash -c".

Standard input, output, and error are connected to the command.  Unlike qvm-run
in Dom0, this tool does not propagate exit codes, nor does it offer protection
against the remote VM messing with your terminal if standard output is your
terminal.

You can use @dispvm or \$dispvm or --dispvm instead of vmname to start a new
DisposableVM.
