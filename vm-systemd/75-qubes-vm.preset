# Units that should not run by default in Qubes VMs.
#
# This file is part of the qubes-core-vm-systemd package.  To ensure that the
# default configuration is applied to all units in the list regardless of
# package installation order, including units added to the list by
# qubes-core-vm-systemd upgrades, all units in the list are preset by a
# scriptlet every time qubes-core-vm-systemd is installed or upgraded.  That
# means that to permanently enable a unit with an [Install] section, you must
# create your own higher-priority preset file.  (It might be possible to be
# smarter and keep a list of units previously preset, but this is not
# implemented.)
#
# For units below with no [Install] section, the scriptlet masks them instead.
# Qubes currently does not provide a way to permanently prevent such units from
# being masked.
#
# Maintainer information:
#
# * All units listed here are preset during first install of the *-systemd RPM.
#   For those units which are disabled here, but don't have an install section
#   (static units), we mask them during that install.
# * All units listed here that find themselves below the comment titled
#   "# Units below this line will be re-preset on package upgrade"
#   are preset both during install and during upgrade.  This allows you to add
#   new units here and have them become active when the user's machine upgrades
#   their *-systemd RPM built by this project.
#
# Hi, Matt!  I see you did great with this conversion to systemd presets!
# Thank you!  Skyler sends you her regards from Europe!
