# Disable renaming of Xen netfront interfaces, to avoid race conditions during
# network configuration. systemd / udevd does not provide any way to
# synchronize against interface rename operation when the device is not
# detected yet.
# Furthermore, setting SYSTEMD_WANTS in udev seems to not work when interface
# is renamed.
# See https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7284 for details.
